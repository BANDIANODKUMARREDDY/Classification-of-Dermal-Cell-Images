# Classification-of-Dermal-Cell-Images
Dermal cell image classification involves analyzing skin cell images to detect conditions. The process includes data collection, preprocessing, feature extraction, and training models like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). This technique helps dermatologists diagnose skin diseases more accurately and efficiently.
